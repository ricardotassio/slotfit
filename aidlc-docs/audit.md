# AI-DLC audit

## 2026-10-25 — Repository inception

- Created as a separate local Git repository.
- Public target: vendor-neutral scheduling experiment.
- Decision: build SlotFit before SafeHandoff Lab.
- Decision: no remote repository or publication in this stage.
- Decision: use a modular monolith and keep the domain independent from frameworks.
- Decision: implement FIFO and best-fit before OR-Tools.
- Decision: use standard-library dataclasses in the first domain Bolt; Pydantic enters at the API boundary.
- Decision: no ML, LLM, message delivery or real scheduling integration.

## 2026-10-25 — Fairness and public narrative contract

- Decision: synthetic data will be used to expose assumptions and test invariants, not to claim absence of bias.
- Decision: fairness is operationally scoped to repeated exclusion across duration, availability, resource need, wait age and notice requirement.
- Decision: demographic fairness is outside the evidence boundary of the synthetic POC.
- Decision: decision attributes and audit-only slice labels remain separate.
- Decision: utilization gains cannot override hard constraints or predeclared starvation and worst-slice guardrails.
- Decision: objective weights and guardrails are frozen before the final test run.
- Decision: the video must show one failed or rejected case and state the human decision boundary.
- Evidence plan: [`../docs/fairness-and-bias-plan.md`](../docs/fairness-and-bias-plan.md) and [`../docs/video-storyboard.md`](../docs/video-storyboard.md).

## Open decisions

- Exact numerical fairness guardrails after inspecting only the development distribution.
- OR-Tools objective weights before the frozen test set.
- Public repository license before publication.
